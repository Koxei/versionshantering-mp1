# Hot Spot

Hot Spot is a news site that makes an API call to [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) and displays the latest news on our site. The site allows the user to search for news by keywords and view news by categories.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

:warning:Unfortunately the free service provided by newsapi.org has undergone changes, limiting API calls to a local context. As a result, the news feature will not be able to function on Github Pages.


### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the repository in your code editor and create your branch ``` $ git branch "your branch name" ```
3. Switch from 'main' branch to your one ``` $ git checkout "your branch name" ```
4. Have fun!
